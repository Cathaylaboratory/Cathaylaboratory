## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am a 24 years-old Asian language developer based on UK.
## My langugages
I use Chinese, Shanghainese, English and Cantonese. 
I am also familiar with Vietnamese and Taiwanese.
I acknowledge the writing system of Korean, Japanese, Thai, Deutsch, French, and Russian.
I am used to programming at Rime, Keyman and Keyboard App Builder of SIL Language.
## Shanghainese IME developing program
I am the Chief of Shanghai IME APP building. Our goal is to develop an keyboard App for Shanghainese on PC and phone. We expect to pubish the App on Google Play, and App Store. I will try to include variations of Shanghainese and other dialect and variations of scripts of Goetians. Please contact me if you are interest in this program.
## Romanization keyboards
I have develop Ningpo, Soochow, and Taichow language keyboard, the east-Hokkienese keyboards, Taigi Viet Telex keyboard, Hainam and Teochewnese Romanization keyboard. I tried to develop a Cantonese romanization method which apply vietnamese tone mark on the top of the vowels, then I made a keyboard for it. I simulate the Idea of vietnamese Telex keyboard on those Asian languages which has a history of romanization.
## My tools and platforms
I am good at designing romanization keyboards for Asian languages. I worked on Keyman developer and Keyboard App builder.
I am interested in designing keyboard of Asian Languages for maximizing utility. Every keyboard which I have designed will be aimed to be effective for civilian communication, not just a tool to recording and transcripting bible.
You can download those keyboard apps on Keyman website by searching their name. I expect to merge those romanization keyboard with typing Chinese characters in the future if someone can help me to build those apps.
I believe every ethnic have the right to use their language in digital era.
